Electric Motor Temperature Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the rotor temperature of a Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM). Accurate temperature prediction is crucial for optimizing motor performance, ensuring longevity, and preventing overheating in various applications, from robotics to industrial drives.

We explore different regression algorithms, perform comprehensive data analysis, and deploy the best-performing model into a simple Flask web application for interactive predictions.

Problem Statement
The goal is to design a machine learning model with proper feature engineering to predict the rotor temperature (pm column) of an electric motor. We compare the performance of Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. After identifying the best-performing algorithm, the model is saved and integrated with a simple Flask web app that takes user input, predicts rotor temperature, and displays the result.

Project Objectives
By the end of this project, I aimed to:

Understand and classify a regression problem.

Apply various data preprocessing and cleaning techniques.

Implement and compare different machine learning regression algorithms.

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2).

Build a basic web application using the Flask framework to serve the ML model.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Electric Motor Temperature dataset, publicly available on Kaggle. It comprises sensor data collected from a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) on a test bench.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following key directories and files:

ElectricMotorPrediction/ (Root Directory):

Rotor Temperature Detection.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the machine learning model building, training, and evaluation steps.

measures_v2.csv: The raw dataset file. (Note: This file is ignored by Git; please download it from the Kaggle link above).

model.pkl: The saved best-performing machine learning model after training. (Note: This file is ignored by Git; it's generated by running the Jupyter Notebook).

scaler.pkl: The saved StandardScaler object used for feature scaling. (Note: This file is ignored by Git; it's generated by running the Jupyter Notebook).

Flask/ (Web Application Directory):

app.py: The Python script that runs the Flask web server, loads the trained model, and handles predictions.

templates/ (HTML Templates Folder):

home.html: The main landing page for the web application.

Manual_predict.html: An HTML form for users to manually input motor parameters for prediction.

Sensor_predict.html: A placeholder HTML page for simulated sensor data input and prediction.

Prerequisites & Setup
To run this project on your local machine, you need Python installed along with several libraries.

Python: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from python.org. Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

Open Command Prompt (CMD): Search for "CMD" or "Command Prompt" in your Windows Start Menu and open it.

Install Required Python Libraries: In the Command Prompt, run these commands one by one:

pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install Flask

How to Run the Project
Follow these steps to get the machine learning model and web application running on your computer:

A. Prepare the Dataset and Model Files
Unzip the Project: Download and extract the project .zip file (or clone this repository if you're viewing this on GitHub). You'll get the ElectricMotorPrediction folder.

Download the Dataset: Download measures_v2.csv from the Kaggle link provided above and place it directly into the ElectricMotorPrediction folder.

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

In your Command Prompt, navigate to the ElectricMotorPrediction folder:

cd C:\Path\To\Your\ElectricMotorPrediction

(Replace C:\Path\To\Your\ with your actual path).

Start Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

This will open a new tab in your web browser.

In the browser, navigate to your ElectricMotorPrediction folder and click on Rotor Temperature Detection.ipynb.

Once the notebook opens, go to the "Kernel" menu at the top, and select "Restart & Run All".

Purpose: This will execute all the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. Crucially, it will generate the model.pkl (your trained model) and scaler.pkl (the data scaling tool) files in your ElectricMotorPrediction folder. These files are essential for the web application.

This step might take a few minutes.

B. Run the Flask Web Application
Open a NEW Command Prompt window. (Keep the Jupyter Notebook window open if you like, but use a separate CMD for Flask).

Navigate to the Flask application folder:

cd C:\Path\To\Your\ElectricMotorPrediction\Flask

(Again, replace C:\Path\To\Your\ with your actual path).

Start the Flask App:

python app.py

Access the Web App: Look for a line in the CMD output that says * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Open your web browser and go to that address: http://127.0.0.1:5000

Interact with the App:

You'll see a home page with options for "Manual Data Input" and "Sensor Data Input".

Click on either option, enter numerical values into the input fields (you can use values from the measures_v2.csv file for realistic inputs), and click "Predict Rotor Temperature".

The predicted rotor temperature will be displayed on the page.

To Stop the Web App: Go back to the CMD window where the Flask app is running and press Ctrl + C.

Model Performance Summary
After comparing Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM, the Random Forest Regressor demonstrated the best performance for predicting rotor temperature, achieving a high R-squared score and low error metrics.
